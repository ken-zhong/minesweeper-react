# Minesweeper

Built in JavaScript and React.

Bundled with Webpack and transpiled with Babel. All the original game and view JS files are in the /lib folder.

Still todo:
  - jazz up the styling
  - add 'mines left' counter
  - add timer
  - change grid size from simple 'X by X' to 'X by Y', allowing non-square shapes.
