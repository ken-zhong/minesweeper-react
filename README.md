# Minesweeper

Built in JavaScript and React, with an Express server and MongoDB/Mongoose database to persist high scores. Live site: https://ken-zhong.github.io/minesweeper-react/

Bundled with Webpack and transpiled with Babel. All the original game and view JS files are in the /lib folder.

Still todo:
  - jazz up the styling, add smiley face progress element
  - add 'mines left' counter
  - add timer
  - add long press == right click for mobile
